//ECMAScript is a standard specification for scripting languages like JavaScript. It defines the core features and //syntax that a scripting language should have. The most commonly used version is ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and its //subsequent versions.
//
//JavaScript is a programming language that implements the ECMAScript standard. In addition to the core features //defined by ECMAScript, JavaScript includes additional features and APIs (like DOM manipulation in web browsers) //that are not part of the ECMAScript standard.
//
//In summary, ECMAScript is the standard that defines the language's core, while JavaScript is an implementation of //that standard, often with extra features.
