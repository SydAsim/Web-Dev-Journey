 <!-- ELMEMENTS AND TAGS IN HTML -->
  <!-- 
 HTML Elements
An element in HTML represents everything from the opening tag to the closing tag, including the content between them (if any).

Example:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
In this case:

The entire <p>This is a paragraph.</p> is an HTML element.
Self-closing elements also count as elements:

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Example Image">
This is a self-closing HTML element, even though it doesnâ€™t have separate opening and closing tags.


HTML Tags
A tag is just the part of the syntax enclosed in angle brackets (<>) used to define an element.
Tags come in pairs (opening and closing) or as self-closing.
Opening tag: <div>, <p>, <img>
Closing tag: </div>, </p>
Self-closing tag: <img> or <br>

Example:
For this element:
<div>This is a container.</div>
<div> is the opening tag.
</div> is the closing tag.

Difference Between Elements and Tags
Aspect	Tags	Elements
Definition	Syntax enclosed in < > brackets.	Everything from the opening tag to the closing tag, including content.
Type	Can be opening, closing, or self-closing.	Includes tags and content.
Example	<p> and </p>	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
Examples of Common Elements and Tags

Block Elements (Structural Tags):
<div>, <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>
These define containers or sections of content.

Inline Elements (Content Tags):
<span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>
These style or display inline content.
Form Elements:
<form>, <input>, <button>, <label>, <textarea>

Media Elements:
<img>, <video>, <audio>
Summary
Tags are the building blocks of HTML that define the structure or function of an element.
Elements are the full constructs that include tags and their content.
