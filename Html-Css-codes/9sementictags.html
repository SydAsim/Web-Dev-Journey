Block Elements, Inline Elements, and Media Elements
Block Elements:

These create structure and occupy the full width of their container.
Examples: <div>, <section>, <header>, <article>, <footer>.
Often used to build the layout of a webpage.
Inline Elements:

These only take up as much width as needed and don't start on a new line.
Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>.
Media Elements:

Used for embedding or displaying media like images, videos, or audio.
Examples: <img>, <audio>, <video>.
2. What Are Semantic Tags?
Semantic tags are HTML5 tags that clearly define the meaning and purpose of the content they wrap. They not only help with webpage structure but also improve accessibility and SEO.

Examples of Semantic Tags:
Structural Tags:

<header>: Represents the header section.
<nav>: Represents a navigation menu.
<main>: Represents the main content of the page.
<section>: Represents a distinct section of content.
<article>: Represents a standalone piece of content.
<footer>: Represents the footer section.
Content Tags:

<figure>: Represents a figure, often with an image and caption.
<figcaption>: Provides a caption for the figure.
<mark>: Highlights text.
3. Why Are Semantic Tags Important for SEO?
Semantic tags enhance website structure and make it easier for search engines to understand the content. Here's how they help in SEO:

Improved Crawling: Search engine crawlers understand the purpose of semantic tags better than generic <div> or <span>, allowing them to prioritize important content.

For example, <header> indicates a page's top section, which often contains the title and navigation.
Accessibility: Semantic tags help screen readers interpret the content for visually impaired users, improving user experience.

Rich Search Results: Semantic tags combined with structured data (e.g., Schema.org) can lead to rich snippets in search results (e.g., star ratings, FAQs).
