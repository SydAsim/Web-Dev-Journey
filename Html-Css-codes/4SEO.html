<!-- SEO Practices in 2025
SEO in 2025 is less about relying solely on meta tags and more about a holistic approach that integrates:

User Experience (UX):
Fast loading times, mobile-first design, and intuitive navigation are critical.

Quality Content:
Content remains king. Search engines favor content that is informative, relevant, and engaging.

Technical SEO:
This includes site structure, schema markup (structured data), secure connections (HTTPS), and proper indexing practices.

Engagement Metrics:
Behavioral signals like dwell time, bounce rate, and click-through rate inform search engines about the user satisfaction level, indirectly affecting rankings.

Backlinks and Authority:
High-quality backlinks and domain authority continue to be significant factors in ranking.

In this context, meta tags are one piece of the puzzle—a useful tool that supports the broader goal of delivering a great user experience and clear content signals to search engines. -->

<!-- WEB CRAWLERS
 A **crawler**—often referred to as a **spider** or **bot**—is an automated program used primarily by search engines to systematically browse the web. Here’s a breakdown of what crawlers do:

- **Indexing:**  
  Crawlers visit web pages to gather data and update search engine indexes, ensuring that the latest content is searchable.

- **Following Links:**  
  They navigate from one page to another by following hyperlinks, which helps in discovering new or updated content.

- **Analyzing Content:**  
  The data collected by crawlers is analyzed to understand page structure, keywords, and relevance, which then influences search rankings.

- **Respecting Guidelines:**  
  Crawlers typically follow rules set in a website's `robots.txt` file, which specifies which pages should or should not be crawled.

In essence, crawlers are the backbone of search engines, enabling them to efficiently index the vast amount of information available on the internet.
